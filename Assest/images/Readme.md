##  How It Works

The Akan naming tradition assigns names based on:
- **Day of the week** you were born
- **Gender** (Male/Female)

| Day       | Male Name | Female Name |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Sunday    | Kwasi     | Akosua      |
| Monday    | Kwadwo    | Adwoa       |
| Tuesday   | Kwabena   | Abenaa      |
| Wednesday | Kwaku     | Akua        |
| Thursday  | Yaw       | Yaa         |
| Friday    | Kofi      | Afia        |
| Saturday  | Kwame     | Ama         |

Example:  
- A **male** born on **Wednesday** = **Kwaku**  
- A **female** born on **Saturday** = **Ama**
